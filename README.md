### About

Virtual Services TCP/IP, or VServ TCP/IP for short, is a Java library that
enables you to easily manipulate IP and TCP packets.  It is intended for
use in conjunction with a library which generates packets, such as
VServ IPQ, as byte arrays.  At the moment it supports only IPv4 packet
manipulation.

The API is still in flux; some methods are missing and some existing
methods will likely be renamed.  If you would like something added,
please submit a patch in unified diff format.


### Requirements

VServ TCP/IP has been validated against Java 1.8 to compile and run.

### Compiling

The source code requires Apache Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) to compile.
